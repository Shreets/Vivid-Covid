## VIVID-COVID

A ReactJS based web application displaying covid-19 recovery cases.
Link to the site :  [Vivid-Covid](https://shreets.github.io/Vivid-Covid/).

### Description

The website uses an API that fetches data provided by John-Hopkins. The site is built on the note to only show positive COVID-19 statistics and hence only displays total cases and recovered cases - both globally and country wise. 

**Note: The api used is the best that could be laid hands on for free. The data displayed are timely updated and accurate. However the api used for maps doesn't show data for USA and canada ( Although, the data is displayed in statistics cards). This API needs updates. The site will use a better api or will work around existing one to solve this problem soon.**
